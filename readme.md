<h1>THIS MODIFICATION IS NOW DEPRICATED DUE TO UI CHANGES INTRODUCED BY BLIZZARD IN 10.0 --- THAT WAS FUN! :D</h1>

<h2>What is Open AzeriteUI?</h2>
Open AzeriteUI is a moveable, scalable, more-compatible version of AzeriteUI by <span style="font-weight:700;font-size:15px"><a href="https://github.com/goldpaw" target="_top">Goldpaw</a></span>.
<br/><br/>
Scalable, and permanently compatible with MoveAnything, Open AzeriteUI is intended as a UI frame replacement for World of Warcraft players who prefer to play with a controller, or maybe prefer a large, easy to read UI for couch gaming.
<br><br>
This UI is highly experimental, and breaks many design features by the original author. Bugs  will happen. For the best experience, please see the download list below.

<h2>Changes from original</h2>
Replaced Azerite crystal with class resource-colored orbs for a cleaner look.
<br>
All frames now moveable! - Disabled randomization process in widget/frame construction. This prevented MoveAnything from being able to grab frame ID's.
<br>
Removed action bars completely.
<br>
Removed chat customizations.
<br>
Removed various incompatability prevention measures.
<br>
Cleaned up various legacy items.

<h2>Quick-Start Guide</h2>
Unzip OpenAzeriteUI and all required addons into your [/World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons] directory.
<br>
When in game, if you want to move the frames, you'll need to add them to MoveAnything by typing:
<br>
<br>
/move GP_WidgetContainer_1  --- This is the Player frame.
<br>
/move GP_WidgetContainer_7 --- This is the Target frame.
<br>
/move GP_WidgetContainer_55 --- This is the Target of Target frame.
<br>
/move GP_WidgetContainer_49 --- This is the Focus Target frame.
<br>
<br>
/setScale <0-1> --- Sets the UI Scale. For example, "/setScale .95" is shown in the screenshot above.
<br>
<br>
Until I compile a list of all known frame names (or auto-add them with another addon), these should get you started! If you need help using MoveAnything, please see the link in downloads for documentation.
<br>
I would highly recommend, if you want pretty bars, chat frames, etc., to please look through the optional downloads above.

<br>
<br>
<h2>To-Do List</h2>
Add native frame movement, so we don't need MoveAnything.
<br>
Rework Goldpaws chat module
